What do ecologists believe about species interaction matrices?
===================

I'm thinking about how one would design generic priors over possible species interaction matrices.  This could eventually become a paper, but for now it's just scribbling.  Please submit pull requests or issues if you have ideas/references/other contributions.

Here are some hypotheses that may or may not be supported by the literature, but which should be falsifiable:

* Similar species (e.g. close relatives or guildmates) are more likely to compete (or at least more likely to interact)
* Species with similar resource needs are more likely to compete
* Most pairs of [non-sessile?] species interact weakly, if at all
* Species interactions are strongest at small spatial scales
* Generalists mainly interact along a few important resource axes; specialists' interactions are more idiosyncratic
